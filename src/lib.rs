/// opened can show up in this file buffer.** In particular, if a file is truncated after opening,
/// accessing the removed part causes undefined behavior. On Windows it is possible to prevent this
/// by opening the file in exclusive mode, but that functionality is not available in stable Rust
/// currently. (Filebuffer will be updated after stabilization.)
///
/// It is recommended to ensure that other applications do not write to the file when it is mapped,
/// possibly by marking the file read-only. (Though even this is no guarantee.)
